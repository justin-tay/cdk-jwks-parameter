## Development

Requires Node.js 24.

```

- `npm run clean`: delete `lib/` (runs automatically before `npm pack` / `npm publish`)
- `npm run build`: compile to `lib/` and bundle the Lambda into
  `lib/assets/lambda/handlers/rotation/`
- `npm run typecheck`: type-check sources, the example, scripts and tests
- `npm run lint` / `lint:fix`: lint with [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter), including type-aware rules
- `npm run format` / `format:check`: format with [Oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter)
- `npm test`: bundle the Lambda, then run the tests with coverage (minimums in
  `jest.config.js`), including [cdk-nag](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag) checks.
  Tests use fake AWS credentials and never reach AWS.
- `npm run test:aws`: deploy the example app to the AWS account and region of
  your current credentials, check the parameters' creation and a forced
  rotation of each through the JWKS endpoint, check that each rotation Lambda's
  log group holds only bare ECS records that describe those events, then
  destroy the stack (`-- --keep` to keep it). Costs a few cents. The
  credentials need `logs:FilterLogEvents`, `lambda:InvokeFunction` and
  `ssm:GetParameter` as well as permission to deploy.
- `npm run cdk:synth` / `cdk:diff` / `cdk:deploy` / `cdk:destroy`: build, then
  run the CDK CLI on the example app

CI runs the type check, lint, format check, tests and build on every push and
pull request.

The example imports the package by name (`cdk-jwks-parameter`,
`cdk-jwks-parameter/jwks`), as a consumer would. During development `paths` in
`tsconfig.json` (honoured by `tsx` and esbuild) and `moduleNameMapper` in
`jest.config.js` resolve these to `src/`.

## Logging

The rotation Lambda logs through `src/assets/lambda/logger.ts`, and nothing else
writes to stdout or calls `console`. The events are a closed catalogue
(`EVENTS`), documented in [docs/logging.md](docs/logging.md):

- To log something new, add an ECS-aligned entry to `EVENTS` and to the event
  index and event reference in `docs/logging.md`, instead of writing an ad hoc
  message. Add a field to the schema tables when you add one.
- Never log key material, the parameter value, or an error message that might
  echo one. `errorFields` logs a message only for the error classes it allows;
  add a class there only if this package writes its message.
- Update the OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet control implementation in the same file
  when a change affects a row.

## Commit messages

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
(`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `feat!:` for breaking changes …). They
determine the next version and the changelog, so pick the type that describes
the change for users of the package.

## Releasing

This section is for maintainers.

[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) keeps a release
pull request open with the next version and `CHANGELOG.md`; merging it tags the
release, and the release workflow publishes to npm with
[trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) and provenance.
Versions stay `0.x` until the API is stable. In `0.x`, both `feat:` and
breaking changes bump the minor version, and `fix:` bumps the patch version.

### One-time setup

- The first release has to be published by hand (`npm publish`), because npm
  can only configure a trusted publisher for a package that already exists.
  Then, on npmjs.com, add this repository's `release.yml` workflow and `npm`
  environment as the package's trusted publisher.
- Create the `npm` environment in the repository's settings, optionally with
  required reviewers so each publish needs approval.
- Enable private vulnerability reporting in the repository's security
  settings, which [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) points to.
